# Qubership Integration Platform — Sessions Management

Sessions Management Service is a part of Qubership Integration Platform.
It provides an API to manage recorded sessions of integration flows' execution stored in OpenSearch index.
This service is designed for debugging, monitoring, and analytical purpose and allows full text search in sessions along with complex session filtering.

## Installation

Sessions Management Service is a Spring Boot Application and requires Java 21 and Maven to build.
[Dockerfile](Dockerfile) is provided to build a containerized application.
It can be run locally using a [docker compose configuration](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-integration-platform).

## Configuration

Application parameters can be set by environment variables.

Configuration can be overridden with values stored in Consul.
The ```config/${NAMESPACE}``` prefix is used.

Application has 'development' Spring profile to run service locally with minimum dependencies.

## Dependencies

This service relies on [Design-Time Catalog Service](https://github.com/Netcracker/qubership-integration-designtime-catalog), which is used to provide integration chain names.
It also requires Consul and OpenSearch services.
